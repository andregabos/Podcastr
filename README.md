# Podcastr
### A podcast broadcasting website.

This application was built during the NLW#5 event, a free, week-long course aimed at new and relevant technologies, hosted by Rocketseat.

The project was built with Next.js, taking advantage of its Static Site Gerenation functionality to produce a fast website, using React.js and ContextAPI qualities to manage all the data passed between the components. Along with that, both TypeScript and Sass provide a robust way to scale the project and keep everything clean.

For me, the main challenges of this project were to understand how Next.js handles routing and multiple pages, and to learn how to use ContextAPI applied into managing the state between the home page and the audio player.

Overall this project has taught me a lot, but there are still a few things missing and I plan to add them in the coming weeks.
